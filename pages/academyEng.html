            Pass'Sport Citizen and Pass'Sport Cultural programs <br />
            The <strong>Academic</strong> dimension, supported by methodological
            guidance and homework assistance <br />
            The <strong>Health</strong> dimension, underscored by promoting
            awareness about the dangers of junk food <br />
            The <strong>Athletic</strong> dimension, fostered by instilling
            values like the love of effort, self-improvement, and the ambition
            to continually push boundaries and aim higher...

            <h1>Academic Dimension</h1>
            <p>
              At the Massy Academy, we are much more than just a football club.
              We believe in the importance of taking care of each player in all
              aspects of their life, including their academic journey. We are
              proud to offer a comprehensive educational program that supports
              players in their studies, helps them succeed, and prepares them
              for a promising future.

                <h2>Methodology coaching</h2>
                <p>
                  Our dedicated team regularly organizes methodology coaching
                  sessions, offering 3 to 4 sessions per week. Our coaches are
                  there to provide personalized support, teaching players how to
                  effectively organize themselves to complete their schoolwork.
                  In addition, we play a crucial role in guiding struggling
                  students by acting as a warning signal and redirecting them as
                  needed. <br />
                  <br />
                  Our goal is to harmonize school life and sports life (before
                  hitting the field, the player is encouraged to do their
                  homework first).

                <p>
                  We place a strong emphasis on tracking the progress of our
                  players. To this end, we organize collective and individual
                  quarterly reviews. This allows us to reflect on the successes
                  and difficulties of each player, and adjust our approach
                  accordingly. We also work closely with our players' teachers,
                  establishing a strong link between the school and the club to
                  ensure smooth communication and effective coordination.
